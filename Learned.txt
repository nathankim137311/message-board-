// rendering html elements from Express server 
to render an HTML file into the server using Express.js, we use res.sendFile(). This reads and renders the
data included in one's HTML files. 

    syntax: res.sendFile(path [, options] [, fn])

"__dirname" returns the exact path of your project's directory.

    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(__dirname + "/index.html");
    });

when routed to this page, this renders the file onto the routed page.
